## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-26

### Overview

Complete rewrite from tkinter to PyQt6. New UI framework, new features, bug fixes, and unit tests.

### Added

- **PyQt6 UI** — replaced tkinter with PyQt6 for better widgets, native drag-and-drop, and proper layout resizing
- **Light / Dark theme** — toggle button (🌙/☀️) in header, preference persisted via `QSettings`
- **Smart auto-naming** (`SmartNamer`) — analyzes input filenames to suggest a merged output name with number range (e.g. `A 1-3.cbz`)
- **Auto-clear after merge** — file list, log, and progress bar reset automatically after a successful merge
- **Add Folder → archives** — "Add Folder" now accepts folders containing .cbz/.zip/.cbr/.rar files (enumerates and adds each archive individually)
- **File size display** — each file in the list shows its size in MB
- **Smart name bar** — preview panel showing suggested output filename, visible whenever ≥ 2 files are loaded with Auto-name enabled
- **`MergeWorker(QThread)`** — merge runs in a background thread via Qt signals; UI never freezes
- **`FileListWidget(QWidget)`** — dedicated widget with native drag-and-drop support
- **`requirements.txt`** — pinned dependency list
- **`build.bat`** — one-line PyInstaller build script for `.exe` output
- **22 unit tests** — `CBZMerger` core (13 tests) and `SmartNamer` (9 tests)

### Fixed

- **`add_files` counting bug** — previous version used side-effect trick (`not list.append(f)`) that made the added count always 0 and added dead duplicate-checking code
- **`extract_archive` unreachable code** — old version had a `return False` after the try/except block that was never reached; fixed to single clean catch-all
- **Layout resize bug** — tkinter `grid_rowconfigure(5, weight=1)` was set on the wrong row (progress bar instead of file list); resolved naturally by switching to PyQt6 layouts
- **Unsupported archive format** — now logs a warning instead of silently returning False
- **`natural_sort_key` duplication** — previously defined in both core class and GUI class; now only in `CBZMerger`

### Changed

- Window title: `Yor CBZ Merger` → `CBZ Merger 2.0`
- Footer label: `v3.0 · Yor Edition` → `v2.0 · Crafted by Yor Anupong`
- `tkinterdnd2` no longer required (PyQt6 has native drag-and-drop)
- "Add Folder" dialog title changed to "Select Folder" (accepts both archive and image folders)
- Warning message when folder contains neither archives nor images: `"No supported archives or images found"`

---
